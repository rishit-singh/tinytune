# tool Decorator API Reference

The `tool` decorator is used to create tools that can be used within prompt jobs to extend the capabilities of the language model.

## Decorator Definition

```python
def tool(func: Callable | None = None):
    ...
```

## Parameters

- `func` (Callable | None, optional): The function to be decorated.

## Usage

The `tool` decorator is used to wrap functions that provide specific functionality. These functions can then be called within prompt jobs. The decorator extracts metadata from the function's docstring and type hints.

## Example

```python
from tinytune.tool import tool

@tool
def get_weather(location: str) -> str:
    """
    Gets the weather for a given location.

    Args:
        location (str): The location to get weather for.

    Returns:
        str: A string describing the weather.
    """
    # Implementation here
    return f"Sunny, 25Â°C in {location}"
```

## Notes

- The decorated function should have a clear and descriptive docstring.
- Use type hints to specify the expected types of arguments and return values.
- The tool can be used within prompt jobs to perform specific tasks or retrieve information.

## Using Tools in Prompt Jobs

```python
from tinytune import prompt_job, LLMContext, Message

@prompt_job(id="weather_report", context=your_context)
def WeatherReportJob(id: str, context: LLMContext, prevResult: Any):
    location = "New York"
    weather = get_weather(location)
    return (context.Prompt(Message("user", f"Describe this weather in {location}: {weather}"))
            .Run(stream=True)
            .Messages[-1])
```
